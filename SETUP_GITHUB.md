# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Your project is ready to be pushed to GitHub!

The following cleanup has been completed:
✅ Created comprehensive .gitignore file
✅ Excluded redundant files:
   - Virtual environment (venv/)
   - Python cache (__pycache__/)
   - Node modules (node_modules/)
   - Temporary files (tempCodeRunnerFile.py)
   - Performance logs (performance_logs.json)
   - Uploaded images (pokemon/uploads/*.png)
   - Model backups (pokemon/models/drawing_model_backup_*)
   - Archive files (*.zip)
   - OS files (.DS_Store)
   - Package lock files

✅ Created README.md with comprehensive documentation
✅ Added .gitkeep for uploads directory
✅ Initialized Git repository
✅ Created initial commit

## To push to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Recommended if GitHub CLI is not installed)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Set repository name to: **TheraBrush**
3. Leave it as Public (or choose Private if preferred)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/abdulsamad/Documents/development/projects/therabrush
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TheraBrush.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Option 2: Install GitHub CLI (for future convenience)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI using Homebrew
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Create and push the repository
cd /Users/abdulsamad/Documents/development/projects/therabrush
gh repo create TheraBrush --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Next Steps After Pushing

1. Add a LICENSE file (recommended: MIT License)
2. Set up environment variables in GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)
3. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
5. Add badges to README (build status, license, etc.)

## Important Notes

- The repository excludes large model files and sensitive data
- Make sure to set up environment variables (.env) locally but never commit them
- The main branch is now ready with 40 files committed
- Model backups and temporary files are properly excluded
